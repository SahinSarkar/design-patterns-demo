# E-commerce Product Customization

Dear Candidate,

We run an online store selling custom furniture where customers can choose base products and add custom features to their orders. Each custom feature added could alter the original price of the piece of furniture. Your task is to implement this system using the decorator design pattern in Java.

**Problem Details:**

We offer base items like:

- Basic Chair - $50
- Basic Table - $100
- Basic Bed - $200

We also offer numerous custom features such as:

- Engraved name - $20
- Special wood finish - $30
- Extra padding for chairs - $10
- Extendable feature for tables - $25
- Storage drawers for beds - $50

**Specific Requirements:**

1. Your design should allow a user to choose a base product and then add on any number of custom features.

2. Users should be able to add or remove custom features to/from their selected furniture.

3. Users should be able to see the total cost of their desired product, based on their selected features.

4. The design must follow the decorator pattern so that new features can be added or removed with ease in future updates without a major refactor of the codebase.

Please ensure the code is thoroughly unit-tested and then submit it by the agreed deadline to be reviewed by our software development team.

Good luck, and we're looking forward to reviewing your solution.

Best,  
[Your Name]
